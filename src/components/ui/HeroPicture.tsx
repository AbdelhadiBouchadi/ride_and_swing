/**
 * The hero frame, art-directed across breakpoints.
 *
 * A 21/9 landscape composition is right on a desktop and destroys itself on a
 * phone — `object-cover` would crop the wide frame to roughly its centre fifth.
 * So phones get a separately composed 3/4 frame (a class on the sand watching
 * the lineup) rather than a squeezed version of the wide one.
 *
 * `next/image` scales a single source and cannot express that, so this is a
 * real <picture>: the browser evaluates `media` before fetching and downloads
 * exactly one file. AVIF first, WebP next, JPEG as the floor.
 *
 * The advertised widths stop at the largest crop the client's originals can
 * actually fill — 1440px wide, 1200px portrait. Listing 2800w here would only
 * buy an upscale, and a browser asked to choose between real pixels and
 * invented ones should never be shown the invented ones.
